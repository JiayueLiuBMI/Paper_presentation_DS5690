# X-LoRA: Mixture of Low-Rank Adapter Experts

X-LoRA is a flexible framework for creating adaptable large language models by dynamically mixing multiple pre-trained low-rank adapters (LoRA). It enables the development of LLMs with diverse capabilities across different domains.

## Overview

The primary motivation behind X-LoRA is to integrate various areas of knowledge and expertise into a single language model. This is achieved by combining multiple LoRA adapters, each fine-tuned for specific tasks or domains, at a granular token and layer level.

The approach is inspired by biological principles, where neural network building blocks are reused hierarchically, allowing for the integration of different capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Mixing**: X-LoRA employs a scaling strategy to dynamically gate and mix LoRA adapters based on the input's hidden states, enabling new layer-wise combinations of expertise.
- **Granular Adaptation**: The scaling and mixing of LoRA adapters happen at a fine-grained token and layer level, providing a high degree of flexibility.
- **Efficient Training**: Building upon the low-rank adaptation technique, X-LoRA allows for efficient training by only updating the low-rank matrices associated with each adapter.

## Applications

The paper focuses on developing an X-LoRA model with scientific capabilities, particularly in areas such as:

- Biomaterials
- Protein mechanics
- Materials design

However, the X-LoRA framework can be applied to various domains by training domain-specific LoRA adapters.

## Getting Started

1. Train individual LoRA adapters for different areas of expertise.
2. Train the X-LoRA model using a subset of the combined training data from the individual adapters.
3. Use the trained X-LoRA model for inference, allowing it to dynamically mix the different adapters based on the input.
